  Strict Hensel refinement boundary.

  This module deliberately exports no candidate from the legacy generated
  corpus.  The former safe wrapper selected the L2 `hensel_lift`
  implementation whenever the candidate failed a post-hoc `HenselCorrect`
  check.  That was not an L1→L2 refinement and has been removed.
